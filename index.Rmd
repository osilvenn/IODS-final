# A multiple correspondence analysis of contrastive negation in English  
## Abstract  

## Introduction  
This document is the final project of the course Introduction to Open Data Science (IODS). It is a multiple correspondence analysis of corpus data in English. This introduction will give basic information on the topic and general approach. This will set the stage for the quantitative analysis in subsequent sections.  

By contrastive negation, I refer to a family of constructions which combine a negative part with an affirmative part so that the affirmative part replaces the negative one. In this study, I follow McCawley's (1991) definition, according to which contrastive negation only refers to cases in which the contrasted items fill one and the same syntactic slot; in my other work (Silvennoinen, fc.), I have sometimes operated with a wider definition. Here are some examples of what this means:  
1. I don't like it - I love it.  
2. She did it not once but twice.  
3. "It's not hard work," she said, "just constant." (BNC)  
4. Contracts of employment are agreements between employers and staff - they are not the business of goverment. (BNC)  
5. Children should be seen and not heard.  
6. Shaken, not stirred.  

My study, which is based on data collected for my ongoing PhD project (Silvennoinen, in prep.; see also Silvennoinen, fc.), falls within the realm of corpus linguistics. Corpus linguistics studies language by using collections of naturally occurring texts that are in a machine-readable format. The name for these collections is corpus (plural: corpora). The corpus used in this study is the British National Corpus (BNC), a 100-million-word multi-genre corpus that contains both spoken and written language. Specifically, I use two sub-components of the corpus: the broadsheet newspapers component (which is about 3 million words) and a subset of the conversation component (this subset is about 250,000 words, out of 4 million words in total). The reason for the size difference is that handling the spoken data is much more laborious.  

As the six examples given above show, there are actually several syntactic formats of contrastive negation. It is thus what some linguists call a construction family (Goldberg & Jackendoff). This leads us to ask why language should have this many ways of expressing essentially the same meaning. In other words, what differences do the constructions in examples 1-6 have? This is the research question, and the answer is sought from MCA.  

## The dataset  
The dataset consists of 2,032 examples of the six constructions exemplified above culled from the corpus. The dataset will be referred to as `cn` in what follows. Let us have a look at the structure and dimensions of the dataset The variables that will be of interest to us are the following:  
- `ConstructionType`: the six constructions  
- `SemType`: the semantic type of each construct; a three-level variable whose default value is replacive (not X but Y), the other values being additive (not only X but Y) and restrictive (not X but only Y), based on whether and where there is a restrictive adverb or other restrictive element in the construct  
- `LogLengthDiff`: the length difference of the contrasted elements (with one added to both of them), transformed logarithmically to reduce the influence of outliers  
- `NegType`: the type of negation, i.e. whether the negation is descriptive (ordinary) or metalinguistic (Horn 1985); in other words, does the negator negate the semantic content or is it about such aspects as pronunciation or word choice?  
- `NegGiven`: givenness of the negated element, i.e. whether its referent (or more technically, designatum; Lambrecht 1994) has been mentioned in the previous four sentences  
- `NegFocusCx`: the focus structure of the negative part of the construction (Lambrecht 1994, Van Valin 2005); the focus may be a full verb phrase (predicate-focus, as in I don't like it - I love it) or not (narrow-focus)  
- `Genre`: the genre in which the construct appears in the data; there are nine values for eight sub-categories of newspaper text, plus conversation  

The data was prepared in Excel and only slightly wrangled in R. The construction codes were made more informative and for some of the variables, reference levels were set manually. Unnecessary variables were omitted. The resulting data frame will be called `cn2`. Some of the wrangling (especially assigning reference levels) has been performed to facilitate other analyses performed on the same dataset, such as logistic regression. The script has been placed [here](https://github.com/osilvenn/IODS-final/blob/master/data_wrangling.R).  

## The variables  
In this section, I shall present the relevant variables in more detail. The visual exploration will be done using `ggpairs`.

```{r}
cn3 <- select(cn2, -ConstructionType)
library(GGally)
ggpairs(cn3)
```
Most of the variables are discrete. `NegType`, `NegGiven` and `NegFocusCx` are also highly skewed; `SemType` and `Genre` have a more balanced distribution of the various levels. `LogLengthDiff` is close to normally distributed but not quite as it skews somewhat above zero.  

Because most of the variables are discrete, a correlation plot could not be drawn.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
